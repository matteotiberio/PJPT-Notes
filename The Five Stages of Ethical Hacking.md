# Ethical Hacking

*Ethical hacking*, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, follows a structured approach to identify and fix vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. The ethical hacking process generally involves the following five phases:

1. **Reconnaissance**  
   The reconnaissance phase involves gathering information about the target system or network. It includes passive data collection techniques such as searching publicly available information, browsing websites, and examining DNS records. The goal is to collect as much information as possible to understand the target and identify potential entry points.

2. **Scanning**  
   In the scanning phase, the ethical hacker actively probes the target system or network to discover open ports, active services, and vulnerabilities. Various tools and techniques are used, such as port scanning, network mapping, and vulnerability scanning. This phase helps identify weaknesses that could be exploited.

3. **Gaining Access**  
   During this phase, the ethical hacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to the target system or network. The focus is on exploiting vulnerabilities identified during the scanning phase. Techniques such as password cracking, social engineering, and software vulnerability exploitation may be employed to gain access.

4. **Maintaining Access**  
   Once access is gained, the ethical hacker aims to maintain it within the compromised system or network. This phase involves bypassing security mechanisms, installing backdoors or remote access tools, and establishing persistent access. The goal is to simulate the actions of a real attacker and assess the potential impact of a successful compromise.

5. **Covering Tracks**  
   In the final phase, the ethical hacker removes any traces of their activity on the target system or network. This includes deleting logs, modifying or removing files, and restoring the system to its original state. The objective is to ensure the ethical hacking activity remains undetected, leaving no evidence of the penetration testing.
